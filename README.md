# Nature-Insipred-Algorithms
NIA was a course I took during my masters and just loved cuddling up on my sofa and coding all evening. Nevertheless, this whole course's homeworks have been group works. Thus, this code is influenced by others as well.

What you can find is:

- Approaching the Knapsack Problem using Hill Climbing and First-Choice Hill Climbing
- Approaching the Makespan Problem using Genetic inspired Algorithms
- Approaching the Traveling Salesman Problem using Ant Colony Optimization
- Approaching a High-Level Profit Model (example Power Plant Optimization) using Differential Evolution
- Approaching the Vehicle Routing Problem using a variation or combination of nature inpired algorithms (See Presentation for details)
